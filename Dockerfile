# cc is the C compiler, gcc is the GNU C compiler, clang is a C/C++/Objective-C compiler, nvc is the NVIDIA HPC SDK compiler, pgcc is the Portland Group C compiler, icc is the Intel C compiler, and icx is the Intel C++ compiler. We need all this, as they are required to compile the C extensions for some of the Python packages we are using in our project.


#⁠# FROM python:3.8-slim-buster
# Here I'm using the python:3.10-alpine image as the base image


WORKDIR /flask-loan-app
# This will create a directory called flask-loan-app in the container

COPY artefacts/requirements.txt .
# This copies the requirements.txt file from the artefacts directory on your host machine to the current working directory in the container

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
# This command installs the Python packages listed in requirements.txt

COPY . /flask-loan-app/
# This copies the entire contents of the current directory on your host machine to the /flask-loan-app directory in the container

# RUn command only runs while creating the image, CMD command runs when the container is started. 

# Install Docker Desktop from https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/



#Open the Docker desktop application then type following commands
#docker build -t mark1 .
#docker image ls
#docker run -p 8000:8000 mark1 (1st one is ourlocalhost and the second one is container listeming port)

#docker run -p 8000:8000 --name flask-loan-app-container mark1


#docker run -d -p 8000:8000 mark1
# -d flag is for detached mode, which runs the container in the background

#docker container run -it -p 8000:8000 mark2 bash
# -it flag is for interactive mode, which allows you to interact with the container's shell

# first 8000 is the port on the host machine (my local) and the second 8000 is the port on the container

#docker container ls --all

# this will tell us the container id, which we can use to stop the container

#steps for pushing our image to the docker desktop repository , so any one can pull my  docker image and run that

#loginto dockerhub desktop and go to this url and click on ctreate a repo  https://hub.docker.com/repositories/vikassingavarapu?_gl=1*8qxe64*_ga*MTc1NTM0ODA4OS4xNzU3MDcyNjYw*_ga_XJWPQMJYHQ*czE3Njg5MzE4ODIkbzMkZzEkdDE3Njg5MzIwMDQkajM4JGwwJGgw  
#after creating the repo  follow the below steps
#docker image tag mark2:latest shivam13juna/example2-docker:latest 
#here mark2 is the image name, latest is the tag name and shivam13juna is the username on dockerhub and example2-docker is the repo name created on dockerhub 
#my command would be docker image tag mark2:latest vikassingavarapu/2026_docker:latest 
#now paste the command showed in dockerhub desktop to push the image to dockerhub
#docker push vikassingavarapu/2026_docker:tagname
