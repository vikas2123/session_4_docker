#docker image ls 
REPOSITORY                          TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
mark1                               latest    35c89d3ee564   13 seconds ago   692MB

U can see the docker image is running with MArk1 with tag name latest

Now run the container as we had runned the image

#docker run -p 8003:8000 mark1

1st port is our port and the 2nd port is the docker container will run on 8000 and the mark1 is the image name

* Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
 * Running on http://172.17.0.2:8000


 now we has to push this docker image to the docker hub website

step1: Go to https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vikassingavarapu/session_4_docker/general

step2: create the repository with any name 

step3: docker image ls
REPOSITORY                          TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
mark1                               latest    35c89d3ee564   7 minutes ago   692MB
vikas3                              latest    b9a40effeeb5   20 hours ago    691MB
vikassingavarapu/session_4_docker   latest    b9a40effeeb5   20 hours ago    691MB
mark2                               latest    02e96ccdbb1f   20 hours ago  

step4:I want to push the mark1 image to the dockerhub with tag having latest

step6:docker push vikassingavarapu/session_4_docker:latest
